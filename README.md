# hiddenmarkovmodel-cs

A basic Hidden Markov Model implementation written in C#. I wrote this library
as part of my university dissertation, and I have uploaded it here as a basic
HMM implementation.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the
[matrix-cs](https://github.com/karlnicoll/matrix-cs) project that I also wrote
as part of my dissertation.

## A Note About the Training Algorithm

I do not believe that I have correctly implemented the baum-welch
algorithm used to train the model. Please bear this in mind if you wish to make
use of the HiddenMarkovModel class.
